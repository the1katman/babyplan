            <h2>Welcome to YutYut Health!</h2>

            <p>
                Thank you for taking the time to look at our prototype and provide some feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
                YutYut Health was founded by two Marines who understand the importance of planning. After they honorably
                left the Marine Corps, they experienced the same problems that most patients experience in health care;
                confusion, long wait lines, countless questionnaires, improper diagnoses, and unforeseen expenses. The
                two set out to solve these problems using their backgrounds in technology and planning management.
                YutYut Health’s dynamic plan will change as your needs change, it will show you the most up-to-date plan
                based on your heath team’s assessments along with your personal needs. This health plan will empower the
                patient to make the best decisions possible regarding their health.

                Here are some of the upcoming features YutYut Health is currently exploring for a future release.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title">
                Medical Record Management
            </h3>

            <p>
                Why does it feel like every time you go to the doctor's office you have to fill out the same mountain of
                paperwork every time? On top of the that, you have to try to remember nearly every medical-related thing
                that has ever happened to you like your are taking a medical history test of your own history at the
                doctor's office.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our medical record management system is aimed at providing you quick and immediate access to all things
                medically related to you. We want to take the hassle out of you maintaining your own medical records.
                And we want to you to have this access at your fingertips on your mobile devices especially
                when you need it most... like at the doctor's office or the emergency room.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title">
                Cost Estimation
            </h3>

            <p>
                Having a baby can be costly in both time and money. We know that planning for a baby doesn't happen in a
                bubble with an unlimited amount of money to spend. We also realize that medical costs for having a baby
                can be expensive. So, at each step of the way through your pregnancy, we want to provide you with the
                most cost effective options for your medical plans.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our cost estimation feature will take into account your insurance plans and lifestyle to give you better
                customized estimates of what you will be paying out-of-pocket for your chosen health care path. We want
                to show you just what you will be paying, in plain English, with no hidden costs or fees for the medical
                choices you make.
            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title">
                Device Integration
            </h3>

            </p>

            <h3 class="feature-title">
                Differential Diagnosis
            </h3>

            <p>
                You may experience medical issues in your pregnancy. Pregnancy causes enough changes in a woman's body
                that it can sometimes be difficult to determine if your pregnancy has caused a change in your medical
                health or something else has affected your overall health apart from pregnancy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our differential diagnosis tool is intended to help narrow down the medical issue as it may relate to
                your pregnancy. With some additional information, we can help guide you to the appropriate health
                provider to solve your medical needs.
            </p>
